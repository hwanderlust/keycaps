# Keycaps

## Purpose
As a person starting to get interested in custom keycaps and mechanical keyboards and the like, most mainstream e-commerce sites assume the customers know everything. I found myself having to search for what terms meant and the subtle differences between this and that. I wondered why these things weren't being considered and realized the creators of such websites are clearly targeting only those who already know--those willing to invest in such niche products.

I think it creates a barrier of entry who may be starting to gain interest in a new hobby or passion. I wanted to design a UI and UX that would be not only pretty and attractive, but also help spell things out, and display critical info in an easily digestible manner for those shopping and comparing between different stores looking for the best keycaps suitable for them.

*With that said, this originally isn't meant to be a fully functional e-commerce site. Though, maybe one day I may be invested in expanding it for fun.*
